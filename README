Dear future 97bottle developer,

This directory contains everything that was on the Eldarion servers for
97bottles. I remember it was a bit difficult to get setup, but finally got
it going. I've included the virtual environment as there are dependencies in
there (used at the time 97bottles was hosted with Eldarion). I am sure they've
since been updated and that is something to look into when working on the
code base.

I won't be of much help to the code base as I've never even looked at it.

Good luck,
Brian Rosner
